## About Me

I'm Adam, a passionate programmer always looking for new challenges. I've spent my school years building games, GUI interfaces in Python, and even ventured into mobile app development with Java.

### Skills

- **Python:** Developed basic terminal games and GUI interfaces for a budget application school assessments.<br>  
- **Java:** Started with Java for learning programming and later used it to create a budget app using Android Studio with Firebase API. Also utilized the phone's SQLite database for local storage.<br>
- **Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js):** Built a real-time chat website using Node.js and MongoDB, allowing users to create separate private chatrooms.<br>
- **React Native and jQuery:** Worked on mobile app development, focusing on navigation, registration, and login fields, but just the front-end for them.<br>
- **C# and Unity:** Developed a first-person sword-fighting game in Unity using C# with multiple levels, enemy AI, health management, and difficulty settings. The game includes:
  - Two levels, with increasing enemy difficulty.
  - Attack mechanics where the player can only attack after being attacked.
  - Health pickups for the player and enemies to restore health.
  - Collectible swords with unique effects depending on the type of sword.
  - Adjustable difficulty settings that increase or decrease enemy health and damage scaling.
  - Fully designed HUD, UI screens, and in-game scene transitions.<br>

### Current Project

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently working on my **Honours Project**, which focuses on developing a **web-based team project management application** designed for hybrid and remote teams. This project aims to integrate communication, file-sharing, and task management into a single platform, addressing the inefficiencies of existing tools. The goal is to enhance productivity and collaboration for remote teams by streamlining workflows and minimizing the need to switch between multiple applications. 

This project is particularly relevant in the post-pandemic world, where remote and hybrid work continues to be a major part of many industries. By developing an all-in-one web-based solution, this tool aims to provide a seamless and efficient user experience, improving overall team performance.

### Past Projects

- **Real-time Chat Website:** Utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB.<br>

- **Budget Application:** A budget application (made this one first; it was bad; look at the code if you want) made with Python using guizero for the interface and openpyxl for using Excel files.<br>

- **Hit 'Em Back (Unity Game):** A first-person sword-fighting game where players progress through two levels, each with increasing enemy difficulty. The game includes:
  - Health and healing pickups for both the player and enemies.
  - Attack mechanics where players can only attack after being attacked.
  - Swords with unique effects that can be collected.
  - A difficulty setting that adjusts enemy health and damage scaling.
  - A fully designed HUD, UI screens, and game scene transitions.
  - Various game scenes including menus, settings, and HUD for gameplay immersion.

### Learning Goals

ðŸ”­ Once I'm done with my Honours Project, I plan to explore C++ and eventually dive into Rust.
