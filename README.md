## About Me

Hey there! I'm AdamB64, a passionate programmer always looking for new challenges. I've spent my school years building games, GUI interfaces in Python, and even ventured into mobile app development with Java.

### Skills

- **Python:** Developed basic terminal games and GUI interfaces for a budget application school assessments.<br>
  
- **Java:** Started with Java for learning programming and later used it to create a budget app using Android Studio with Firebase API. Also utilized the phone's SQLite database for local storage.<br>

- **Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):** Built a real-time chat website using Node.js and MongoDB, allowing users to create separate private chatrooms.<br>

- **React Native and jQuery:** Experienced in mobile app development, focusing on navigation, registration, and login fields.

<ins>All these are in my repos as public archives since I'll probably not come back to them again.</ins>

### Current Project

ðŸŒ± I'm currently diving into React and TypeScript, working on a task website with MongoDB. It's not just a project; it's my journey to mastering these technologies.

### Past Projects

- **Real-time Chat Website:** Utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB.<br>
